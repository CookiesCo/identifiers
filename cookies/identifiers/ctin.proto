// Defines the structure of a _Cookies Trade Item Number_, abbreviated as a CTIN. In past lives, this identifier was also known as
// the _Cookies Distribution ID_. Every final good produced by Cookies has a CTIN assigned by the Operations department. CTINs are
// used throughout the system to reference single final goods.
//
// CTINs are formatted like: `C123456`. They can specify between `6` and `9` numeric digits after the letter `C`, which is always
// present in the identifier to (1) prevent software from trimming leading `0` characters, and (2) make CTIN values visually
// recognizable by warehouse staff and other supply chain actors.

    // Specifies an exact numeric value generated for this CTIN. The numeric value for a CTIN is allocated from an ordinal row
    // number in a Smartsheet maintained by the Operations department. Because CTINs monotonically increment for each new product,
    // they roughly describe when a product was created, in relation to all other products.
    //
    // Other than described above, CTINs do not typically relate to one another in any reliable meaningful way (an intentional
    // design choice).
