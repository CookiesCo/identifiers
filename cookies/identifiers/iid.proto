 // Defines the structure of a _Cookies Intacct Identifier_, abbreviated as an "IID," and known as an "Intacct Item ID" in
 // shorthand. Every final good, packaging item, and raw material touched by Cookies is issued an IID, which serves as the
 // primary item record key in Intacct.
 //
 // IIDs are issued in Salsify and imported into Intacct with mutual import/export mechanism. They are composed of a single
 // character ("G"), followed by _exactly_ `12` numeric digits between `0` and `9`. The numeric digits express a timestamp
 // value which has been altered: it is taken at millisecond-resolution relative to the Unix epoch, trimmed to the expected
 // digit length, converted to a string, and then reversed by character order.
 //
 // The resulting identifier looks something like this: `G123456789012`. Because the timestamp is reversed, it no longer
 // indexes in monotonically increasing order, enhancing write distribution performance downstream for write/read-heavy
 // tasks like item-level inventory.

     // number in a Smartsheet maintained by the Operations department. Because CTINs monotonically increment for each new
     // product, they roughly describe when a product was created, in relation to all other products.
     //
     // Other than described above, CTINs do not typically relate to one another in any reliable meaningful way (an intentional
     // design choice).
